This Task contains a sourcecode.cpp which class all the functions based on the command lines given 

Functions such as matrix_mkl , matrix_openblas , matrix_pthreads are implemented in separate files and included in sourcefile

on running the sourcecode it gives the time taken by the progarm in stdout and prints the resultant matrix in required file

This directory contains make file available in it 

The following are the make commands

make	: compiles all the files at a time and creates yourcode.out file in the directory along with the .o files

	running commands
	
	./yourcode.out fullyconnected mkl inputmatrix.txt weightmatrix.txt biasmatrix.txt outputmatrix.txt
	
			This commands requires 3 inpult files inputmatrix.txt , weightmatrix.txt , biasmatrix.txt it generates the resultant matrix in coloumn priyority 
			and makes an file name called outputmatrix.txt and prints into it using mkl libraries
			
	./yourcode.out fullyconnected openblas inputmatrix.txt weightmatrix.txt biasmatrix.txt outputmatrix.txt
	
			This commands requires 3 inpult files inputmatrix.txt , weightmatrix.txt , biasmatrix.txt it generates the resultant matrix in coloumn priyority 
			and makes an file name called outputmatrix.txt and prints into it using openblas libraries
			
	./yourcode.out fullyconnected pthreads inputmatrix.txt weightmatrix.txt biasmatrix.txt outputmatrix.txt
	
			This commands requires 3 inpult files inputmatrix.txt , weightmatrix.txt , biasmatrix.txt it generates the resultant matrix in coloumn priyority 
			and makes an file name called outputmatrix.txt and prints into it using pthreads
			
make clean :

	This command clears all the .o files and yourcode.out file
	
GNU-Plots

There are 3 files available mkl_plot , openblas_plot,pthreads_plot 

	these files has the data of n and time taken where n is dimension of matrix (n*n) and time taken by respective functions in execution
	
There is a "gnuplot.script.p" file available which contains gnuplot script 

In terminal set the path to the directory of all the folders

type	gnuplot
type	load "gnuplot.script.p"

There will be a file popped out available to you which has gnuplot with error bars of every libraries.

gnuplot.pdf is available to you which contains the plot generated by the data
